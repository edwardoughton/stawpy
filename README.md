# Wardriving Analytics for Wi-Fi with Python (wawpy)

This repo provides code to develop estimated Wi-Fi analytics using both data collected by
'wardriving', and a predictive model developed using national statistics.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving):

    Wardriving is the act of searching for Wi-Fi wireless networks by a person usually in a
    moving vehicle, using a laptop or smartphone. Warbiking, warcycling, warwalking and
    similar use the same approach but with other modes of transportation.

The etymology of the name originates from wardialing, a method popularized by a character
played by Matthew Broderick in the film WarGames and named after that film. Wardialing
consists of dialing every phone number in a specific sequence in search of modems.

Wardriving has become a widely used method by researchers focusing on mobile computing and
networking security, but there has been very little examination of the statistical issues
with this approach.

This code provides us with the ability to compare Wi-Fi wardriving data with a predictive
model to help us quantify underlying statistical properties. With this knowledge, we can help
to improve future wardriving studies as researchers can introduce methodological designs which
better account for selection bias, sample representativeness and spatial statistical issues
such as the modifiable areal unit problem.

### Setup using conda
The preferred approach is to use Anaconda to handle packages and virtual environments. Hence,
you can first create a conda environment called `wawpy`:

    conda create --name wawpy python=3.7

Activate it (run this each time you switch projects):

    conda activate wawpy

Install any required packages (mainly visualization-related):

    conda install geopandas matplotlib seaborn pykml


### Preprocessing
To preprocess the statistical area data run the following from the `scripts` folder:

- preprocess.py

This processes all local statistical areas for England, Wales and Scotland for both premises
and households. After calculating the population in each area, the 'oa_lookup.csv' file is
written which contains information for each statistical unit, such as the population density
or urban-rural geotype.


### Running the scripts for processing self-collected (sc) WiGLE data
There is a set order in which to run the code from the `scripts` folder, as follows:

- oa_list.py
- prems.py
- sc.py

The `oa_list.py` processes all collected WiGLE .kml data files and exports the
`all_collected_points.shp` file to the `data/intermediate` folder. It finally writes
out the `oa_list.csv` to the same folder.

Next, the `prems.py` script processes the ITRC premises-level data into the
`data/intermediate` folder for each statistical area.

All self-collected data are then processed via the `sc.py` script which adds a set buffer to
each data point and intersects this shape with other APs and buildings. Data are written out
to the `results` folder.


### Running the scripts for estimating national Wi-Fi availability

To make a national estimate of fixed broadband adoption and Wi-Fi availability, for all areas
using national statistics (ns), run the `ns.py` script:

- scripts/ns.py


### Visualizing Wi-Fi availability results

Finally, the `vis.py` script takes self-collected data for all areas, along with the
national estimates from the predictive model, to produce a set of plotted visualizations:

- vis.py
